# üì¶ EthioMart: Amharic Named Entity Recognition for Telegram E-Commerce

## üßæ Project Overview

**EthioMart** is an AI-driven initiative that aims to unify Ethiopia's growing Telegram-based e-commerce landscape into a centralized platform. As independent sellers increasingly use Telegram to promote and sell products, customers face the challenge of discovering and comparing products spread across dozens of decentralized channels.

This project solves that challenge by **automatically extracting key product details**‚Äîlike product names, prices, and locations‚Äîfrom **Amharic messages, images, and documents** posted in Telegram groups. These entities are identified using a fine-tuned **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** model built on top of multilingual transformer models like XLM-Roberta or Amharic-specific models.
